# Test Format

Test item formats used in this examination are:

* Multiple-choice: Examinee selects one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.
* Multiple-response: Examinee selects more than one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.

All the questions asked in the exam are scenario-based. There are three parts to each question: A scenario, a question, and the options.

* A _**scenario**_ describes a situation with a use case or a client requirement on a Drupal site.
* Then a _**question**_ is asked about the scenario or the problem.
* Four or more _**options**_ are given as possible solutions, from which the candidate needs to select the correct answer or answers. Take a look at the sample question:

**Scenario**

One of the business requirements for the "News" section of your company's site is to be able to associate a "News item" with a product. The Product and News item content types have already been created.

**Question**

How can you modify Drupal's data architecture to enable relating a news item to a product?

**Answer Choices**

1. Add a content type connector using the Layout builder module.
2. Add taxonomy reference field on news item that targets product..
3. Add an entity reference field on news item that targets product.
4. Add a Relationship to product while building a View of news items

\(Correct answer - 3\)

After looking at the sample question, you may realize that the questions rely on the application of Drupal concepts and knowledge rather than purely memorizing the facts, code, or syntax.

Reading through long lists of documentation or books is not sufficient for answering most questions. You need experience with a number of use cases, applications, and common scenarios in a Drupal project. It will also help to have experience with support requests and issues to handle questions of this nature
